## Description
As a Conference Talk volunteer, we would like a system that encourages and captures survey comments from Conference talks rapidly so that we are not manually entering in 100 cards per hour as it is very boring. We know, we are done when we have a system that will automatically enter 60-100% of the comments without sacrificing response rate.

We need a way to gather comments from participants. We've found that online surveys have a very low response rate, so we've been favoring paper cards. The paper cards are labor-intensive. We either need a solution that scans most of the comments from the paper cards or that incentivizes participants to enter them digitally.
